# KRunner-Spotify

This plugin allows you to easily control [Spotify](https://www.spotify.com/) using [KRunner](https://github.com/KDE/krunner). The plugin uses [Spotipy](https://github.com/plamere/spotipy) to interact with the [Spotify Web API](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/). Using only a handful of words the user can control Spotify in a straightforward manner, even if Spotify does not run on the same device as KRunner is running. 


# Queries

The queries which can be entered are made out of the following parts:

* [Main-Command](#Main-Commands) | **Required**
* [Sub-Command](#Sub-Commands)  | **Optional**

A `query` has to be started with a `main-command` and can thus only contain one `main-command`. Depending on the chosen `main-command` either nothing, a `sub-command` or argument(s) have to be supplied. If a `sub-command` has to be supplied this `sub-command` can require argument(s).

Examples:
```
$[Main-Command]
```

```
$[Main-Command] $[Arg1] $[Arg2]
```

```
$[Main-Command] $[Sub-Command] $[Arg1] $[Arg2]
```

To be clear, a `main-command` can **either** have a `sub-command` or have one or more argument(s). Due to the fact that the `sub-command` can have argument(s), a `query` can in fact contain a `main-command` , `sub-command` and one or more argument(s).
The following is thus **not allowed**:
```
$[Main-Command] $[Arg1] $[Sub-Command] $[Arg1] $[Arg2]
```
<br/><br/>
